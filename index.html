				<p>This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things.<br><br>Don't fiddle with it all day. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Learn when to stop. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. With practice comes confidence. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush.
